[Publications](https://hayato-n.github.io/publications/) page was updated.

We released the new paper “*Stochastic gradient geographical weighted regression (sgGWR): scalable bandwidth optimization for geographically weighted regression*” on International Journal of Geographical Information Science ([Link to Paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2023.2285471)).
This is a joint work with Prof. Yasushi Asami.

We propose a computationally scalable method to calibrate bandwidth hyper-parameters for GWR models.

I will share a open source software of sgGWR implemented in Python.
Please check it and apply for various geographical analyses!
