[Publications](https://hayato-n.github.io/WebPage/pages/publications.html#publications) page was updated.

We released the new paper “*The illusion of a hedonic price function: Nonparametric interpretable segmentation for hedonic inference*” on Journal of Housing Economics ([Link to Paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhe.2021.101764)).
It provides the theoretical motivation of market segmentation and proposes the novel automatic segmentation method.
I will release the source codes for this novel method soon.
